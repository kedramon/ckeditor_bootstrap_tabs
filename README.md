# CKEditor Bootstrap Tabs
This module is created to allow users to easily insert Bootstrap tabs structure into content.
It will be useful for themes based on [Bootstrap theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap).

The idea is taken from http://ckeditor.com/addon/bootstrapTabs source. But instead of plugin implementation this module implemented as a widget and it has more options.

First of all it require [Widget plugin for CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/addon/widget).
Here is a link with a ready build http://ckeditor.com/builder/4aa56d967057f1cfe925bceb9b98049d, or it can be added manually.

A dialog allows the user to choose the number of tabs when inserting new object. 
Using context menu user can:
* choose a tab to remove
* choose a default tab
* add tab before current tab
* add tab after current tab 
* change the tab title. 

Page can contain multiple items of widgets.
